# StonkCompanion

A collection of utilities and quality-of-life features created by StonkCo, designed to improve your experience in the Monumenta player market.

### Features
- Mistrade calculator (in participating stores.)
- Automatic "Fair Stonk" price estimator for easier trading with other players in /tr.
- Toggleable "Barrel Checkpointer" shop managers can use to snapshot barrel contents to refer to later to detect coreprotect errors.
- Modifies coreprotect's output to display the Monumenta item name instead of the Minecraft base item.
- No telemetry....yet.*
- *ever. Probably.

### Known Rough Edges
- The mod currently only distinguishes between 'currencies' and 'items', and will not tell you if you put the wrong item into a barrel. This means it cannot properly calculate swap fees for rare swap barrels (for example).
- Network desync can cause issues that have been hard to nail down due to the difficulty of reproducing them, but we believe them to be rare.
- Not all unique monumenta interactions are handled, only Lime Tess (U) and a config setting for whether offhand swap is enabled.

### Warning
StonkCompanion is beta software, and likely contains bugs. Use of this mod to trade in the player market does not remove the need to exercise common sense - your trades remain your responsibility to perform correctly, not the mod's.
